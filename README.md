The repository contains scripts and data related to my thesis "Clause Structure Variation in Biblical Hebrew, a Quantitative Approach"

The data on which the analyses are based are extracted from the ETCBC database of the Hebrew Bible and related texts, 
using the open source software Text-Fabric. See: https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric and also: https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/
The latter link gives a description of the electronic edition of the Hebrew Bible, developed at the ETCBC, which is based on the text
of the fifthe edition of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS).
