In this folder you find four files with tripartite clauses.
These are:
tripartite_bib.csv
tripartite_eppr_bib.csv 
tripartite_xbib.csv
tripartite_eppr_xbib.csv

The xbib-files contain data about clauses from extrabiblical texts. 
The eppr-files contain data about clauses with a so-called Enclitic Personal Pronoun. In these tripartite clauses there is no 
agreement between the subject and the copular pronoun, for instance Psalms 44:5 אַתָּה־ה֣וּא מַלְכִּ֣י אֱלֹהִ֑ים.
